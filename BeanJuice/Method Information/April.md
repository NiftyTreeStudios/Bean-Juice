The April Brewer comes with a custom-designed saucer and cup that you can brew directly in to. With the cup comes a lid to improve the aroma experience, it also allows you to regulate the temperature to your liking.

**What makes this brewer special?**
We have considered the whole experience, from brewing to tasting. Asking ourselves what the best way to brew and enjoy a cup of coffee is? The result is a one of a kind flatbed brewer with a custom-designed bottom that allows unique water flow. This feature creates a sweeter taste experience in all temperatures and generates the highest possible flavor quality. But itâ€™s not just about the brewing process. To enjoy the coffee in the best possible way, we created an innovative lid solution; that allows you to trap aromas and keep temperature stability.

## Variants

**Plastic**: Made with AS Resin, we find that it is the more temperature stable and durable version of the april Brewers Collection.

**Glass**: Handmade flatbed dripper designed to brew clean and sweet coffee, developed with a separate acrylic base.
